# Azentrix 07

[Updated on October 2, 2024]
## Wtf am i doing?

This page is created to be a documentation of my work on first month learning HTML and CSS. I created this repo to backup all my coding files and necessary projects.
Hopefully, i can continue this gallery page because i don't touch HTML and CSS for almost 3 months (hope i don't forget about it💀). I learned Javascript's basic 3 months ago, and i got distracted by University orientation task and other task. In my Uni, i have to use Java, so i almost haven't ever touch Front-end WebDev for 2 months.

## Intro
Azentrix is my HighSchool generation's name. I made this web to be the gallery of our moments. Mostly about our data and will be accessible for our member. But, i have not learned SQL and PHP yet, so it is what it is 😅.
In this web, i have **Home**, **About**, **Member**, and others page. But, it hasn't updated yet because that reason i've wrote above. Maybe, i'll update this page once a week(?) or maybe once a month(?) Mwehehe. (bro's getting freaky). To be honest, i want to switch to BackEnd or Cyber Security fields. So, i don't know if i have to do something wiyh this page or no. I guess we'll never know🤷‍♂️🤫🧏‍♂️  

I don't know who will read this shit, but thank you for reading it. >>>
